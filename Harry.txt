The novels revolve around Harry Potter, an orphan who discovers at the age of 11 that he is a wizard,though he lives within the ordinary world of non-magical people known as Muggles,
wizarding world hashidden itself from the Muggle world, presumably to avoid persecution of witches and wizards, which hadoccured to a great extent several centuries before. His magical ability is inborn, and children with suchabilties are invited to attend an exclusive magic school that teaches the necessary skills to succeed in thewizarding world. Harry becomes a student at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and it is herewhere most of the events in the series take place. As Harry develops through his adolescence, he learnsto overcome the problems that face him: magical, social and emotional, including ordinary teenagechallenges such as friendships, infatuation and exams, and the greater test of preparing himself for theconfrontation in the real world that lies ahead.The series was originally printed in English by two major publishers, Bloomsbury in the United
Kingdom and Scholastic Press in the United States. The seven books adapted into an eight-
part film series by Warner Bros. Pictures, which is the second highest-grossing film series of all
time as of August 2015.
